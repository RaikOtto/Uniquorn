Package: Uniquorn
Title: Identification of cancer cell lines based on their weighted mutational/ variational fingerprint
Version: 2.17.3
Authors@R: person("Raik", "Otto", email = "raik.otto@hu-berlin.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 'Uniquorn' enables users to identify cancer cell lines.
 Cancer cell line misidentification and cross-contamination reprents a significant challenge for cancer researchers. 
 The identification is vital and in the frame of this package based on the locations/ loci of somatic and germline mutations/ variations.
 The input format is vcf/ vcf.gz and the files have to contain a single cancer cell line sample 
 (i.e. a single member/genotype/gt column in the vcf file).
