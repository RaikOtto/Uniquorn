\title{Adds a custom vcf file to the three existing cancer cell line panels}
\usage{
add_custom_vcf_to_database( 
 vcf_file_path, 
ref_gen = "GRCH37", 
name_cl = "", 
safe_mode = FALSE, 
distinct_mode = TRUE,
test_mode = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf_file_path}{Input vcf file. Only one sample column allowed.}

\item{ref_gen}{Reference genome version. All training sets are associated 
with a reference genome version. Default: GRCH37}

\item{name_cl}{Name of the to-be-added cancer cell line sample. '_CUSTOM' 
will automatically be added as suffix.}

\item{safe_mode}{Only add mutations to the database where there already are 
mutations found in the cannonical cancer cell lines. This is a safety 
mechanism against overfitting if there are too few custom training samples.}

\item{distinct_mode}{Show training data for the commonly or separately 
normalized training sets. Options: TRUE/ FALSE}

\item{test_mode}{Is this a test? Just for internal use}
}
\value{
Message if the adding has succeeded
}
